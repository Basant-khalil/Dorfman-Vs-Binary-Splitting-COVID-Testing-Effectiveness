## Dorfman vs. Binary Splitting COVID Testing Effectiveness using Python and Probability
### Project Overview:
This project aims to investigate the effectiveness of two widely used COVID-19 testing strategies: 
**_Dorfman testing and Binary Splitting testing_**, using Python and probability-based approaches. 
The goal is to provide a comparative analysis of these approaches in terms of their accuracy, efficiency, and suitability for mass testing scenarios. The study aims to contribute valuable insights to the field of COVID-19 testing, aiding in the development of efficient and reliable testing protocols.

### Key Features:

**1. Dorfman Testing:** This approach involves pooling samples from multiple individuals and conducting a single test on the pooled sample using probability-based algorithms in Python. If the test result is negative, it implies that all individuals within the pool are COVID-free. However, if the result is positive, further individual testing is required to identify the infected individual(s) within the pool.

**2. Binary Splitting Testing:**
In this method, the sample population is divided into smaller subgroups, and individual tests are performed on each subgroup using probability-based algorithms implemented in Python. This process is repeated iteratively until all infected individuals are identified. The main advantage of this approach is its ability to narrow down the infected population rapidly.
