Project Overview:
This project aims to investigate the effectiveness of two widely used COVID-19 testing strategies: 
Dorfman testing and Binary Splitting testing, using Python and probability-based approaches. 
The goal is to provide a comparative analysis of these approaches in terms of their accuracy, efficiency, and suitability for mass testing scenarios.
